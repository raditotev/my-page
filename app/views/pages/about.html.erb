        <h4>Hi, and welcome to my page!</h4>
        <p>
          I'm a full stack developer creating apps using Bootstrap, Foundation, Javascript, jQuery, Ajax, RSpec, Capybara and Ruby on Rails.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've created my first simple HTML page in 2001 as a hobby project. Later I continued experimenting with programming in my spare time by building projects using Dreamweaver or writing code in C for my Arduino experiments.
        </p>
        <p>
           I've got seriously involved in web development in 2013, when I've decided I want to make a living as a programmer and dedicated my entire time achieving this goal. In doing so I've completed Udacity's "Intro to Programming" course and received their nanodegree. Next I've done numerous courses online: Codeacademy's "Python", "Ruby", "jQuery", "JavaScript", "Ruby on Rails" and FreeCodeCamp's "Front End Development" plus a ton of online tutorials or from books like Michael Hartl's "Ruby On Rails Tutotrial". In future, I would like to learn more about and work with MEAN Stack.
        </p>

          In my free time I love to travel, read books, spend time hanging with interesting people, hiking and working on electronic DIY projects. I'm an AOW diver and love the company of the sharks, mantas and other sea creatures big or small. Also I hope this summer (2016) I'll get my paragliding certificate. Wish me luck ;)
