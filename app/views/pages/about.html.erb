  <h4>Hi, and welcome to my page!</h4>
    <p>
      I'm a full stack developer creating apps using Bootstrap, Foundation, Javascript, jQuery, Ajax, Ruby and Ruby on Rails.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've created my first HTML page in year 2000 and in the years after I was palying around with C, writing scripts for Arduino controllers. In 2013 I've decided I want to make a living as a programmer and dedicated my entire time achieving this goal. Last years I've been exposed to Java, Python, Django but I personally find Ruby and Rails more intuitive to work with. In future I would like to learn more and work with Node.js, Angular or React. To find out more about my work visit my <%= link_to "github", "https://github.com/raditotev", target: "_blank" %> account, <%= link_to "portfolio", portfolio_path %> or see my <%= link_to "CV", "https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzG-Z8uID4BRemVIVjRsSk1KbzQ", target: "_blank" %>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my free time I love to travel, read books, spend time hanging with interesting people, hiking and working on electronic DIY projects. I'm an AOW diver and love the company of the sharks, mantas and other sea creatures big or small. Also I hope this summer (2016) I'll get my paragliding certificate. Wish me luck ;)
