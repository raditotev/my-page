# My Personal Page

This is my website containing about page with short biography, links to gihub, google plus etc and my CV. On the portfolio page there is a list of projects I've done in the past and links to the details of each of them. The Blog page is where I'll post articles about things I'm interested about or stuff I recently learned about. Under Contact there is a form from where people can get in touch with me.
